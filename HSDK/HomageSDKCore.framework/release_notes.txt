---------------------
HSDKCore Version 2.1
---------------------


---------------------
HSDKCore Version 2.0
---------------------
New Features:
- Enable bitcode=YES in an app that uses the SDK is now supported.
- Similarity marks (and similarity mark threshold - returns a bg mark error if user is too similar to the background).
- GPUImage integration. Some of the image processing ofloaded to the GPU for better performance.

---------------------
HSDKCore Version 1.12
---------------------
New Features:
- When render progress notifications are posted, extra user info is also included in the notifications user info.
- A uuid can be set on each HCRender object (a uuid is generated automatically on instanciation by default but can be changed any time before setup() is called)
- Video layer loops. If duration of a video layer is shorter than the rendered result, the layer will loop (just like in a gif layer).
- Downsample option added to gif source.

Minor tweaks:
- The userInfo sent on render progress notificiations are also sent on render finished notifications
- Added hcrPlaceHolderIndex key. Used to mark a layer as something that should be replaced with dynamic content in applications before rendering.

Bug fixes:
- Better thread safety in movie writers.
- Fixed video sync issues with low FPS video captured layers that were captured on iPhone4S and iPhone5 when timing effects are used.
- Rotation and scale effects parsing problems on 32bit devices solved.

---------------------
HSDKCore Version 1.11
---------------------
- Bug fix: Background layers of size exactly as the frame size, sometimes (on specific sizes) had an alpha 1 pixel border
            to the right and bottom of the layer. Caused by the transform effects. Bug fixed.

---------------------
HSDKCore Version 1.10
---------------------
- iOS8.1 issue fixed: fileURLWithPath:relativeToURL: is iOS9.1 only. fixed to methods supported by iOS8.1

--------------------
HSDKCore Version 1.9
--------------------
- Added HCPNGOutput. Now possible to render a single frame (can be use to output a thumb image). Will output the frame at the end of the duration by default (Use hcrFrameTime with time in seconds to change that).
- Dynamic masks gif format can be applied to any type of layer (including video source type).

--------------------
HSDKCore Version 1.8
--------------------
New Features:
- Added outputURL method to HCRender. A helper method that returns NSURL to the first file in the outputs array.
- Source layers can be defined as down scaled for creating lower definition output of same resources (480x480 --> 240x240 for example)
- PNG sequence supported as source layer. use [hcrSourceType:hcrPNGSequence, hcrPaths:<array of images paths>]
- Added for historical reason (backward support for emu app): frame number can be passed using hcrFrame instead of hcrTime in transform effects.

- Bug fix: Absolute output paths now work as should using hcrPath key (previously only hcrRelativePath worked properly)


FUTURE:
-----------------------------
Planned HSDKCore Version 1.12
-----------------------------
- Possible to cancel a long render by calling renderer.cancel()
- Possible to get notifications of video render progress by setting renderer.outputProgressNotifications to YES (NO by default)
