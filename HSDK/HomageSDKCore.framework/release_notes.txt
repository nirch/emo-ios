---------------------
HSDKCore Version 1.11
---------------------
- Possible to cancel a long render by calling renderer.cancel()
- Possible to get notifications of video render progress by setting renderer.outputProgressNotifications to YES (NO by default)

---------------------
HSDKCore Version 1.10
---------------------
- iOS8.1 issue fixed: fileURLWithPath:relativeToURL: is iOS9.1 only. fixed to methods supported by iOS8.1

--------------------
HSDKCore Version 1.9
--------------------
- Added HCPNGOutput. Now possible to render a single frame (can be use to output a thumb image). Will output the frame at the end of the duration by default (Use hcrFrameTime with time in seconds to change that).
- Dynamic masks gif format can be applied to any type of layer (including video source type).

--------------------
HSDKCore Version 1.8
--------------------
New Features:
- Added outputURL method to HCRender. A helper method that returns NSURL to the first file in the outputs array.
- Source layers can be defined as down scaled for creating lower definition output of same resources (480x480 --> 240x240 for example)
- PNG sequence supported as source layer. use [hcrSourceType:hcrPNGSequence, hcrPaths:<array of images paths>]
- Added for historical reason (backward support for emu app): frame number can be passed using hcrFrame instead of hcrTime in transform effects.

- Bug fix: Absolute output paths now work as should using hcrPath key (previously only hcrRelativePath worked properly)
