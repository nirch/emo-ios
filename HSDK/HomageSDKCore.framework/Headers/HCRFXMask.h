/**
 *  A mask effect wrapper.
 *  This effect wrapper wraps three types of different implementation of mask effects.
 *  1) Old style CV mask effect supporting only an image as the mask frame (will be deprecated in the future).
 *  2) Old style CV mask effect supporting only an animated gif as mask frames (will be deprecated in the future).
 *  3) New style CV mask effect supporting any source for mask frames (in the future will be the only supported mask effect).
