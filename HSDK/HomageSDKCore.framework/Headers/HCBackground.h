/**
 Background processing.
 API for extracting uniform background behind users' images
 and inspecting images for the quality of the uniform background behind the users.

 The basic workflow with this object:

 - Instantiate the object using the predefined settings provided with the SDK or using custom advanced settings.
 - Send frames for inspection one by one of you are just interested in the uniform background quality mark.
 - To get the BG Mark that is the result of the frame inspection, check the read only latestBGMark property.
 - Send frames for processing one by one if you are interested in actually extracting the user from the background (sets an alpha mask on the background).
 - To get the processed image result, use one of the methods: latestProcessedUIImage, latestProcessedRawImage etc.

 **Important**:

 - The methods of this object are blocking and should be used serially and from the same thread.
 - It is a good idea to always use this object as background work / from a background thread.
 - If you want to process / inspect frames in parallel from more than one thread, create a different instance of the object per thread.
 
 Code Example:

    HCBackground *hcb = [HCBackground new];
    UIImage *image = [UIImage imageNamed:"test-selfie.png"];
    [hcb inspectUIImage:image];
    NSLog(@"The BG Mark of this image is %@", @(hcb.latestBGMark));
    if (hcb.latestBGMark == hcbMarkGood) {
        [hcb processLastInspectedImage];
    }
