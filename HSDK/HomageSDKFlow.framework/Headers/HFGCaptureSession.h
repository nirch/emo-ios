@class HFGCameraPreviewView;

/**
 The object controlling the flow of the camera capture and image processing session.
 
 By default, capture session will use Homage's background removal algorithms for processing frames captured by the camera.
 
 As an optional (advanced) feature, it is possible to replace a different video processing object,
 as long as it complies to the HFProcessingProtocol.
 
 Basic work flow with this object for implementing a recorder that supports BG Removal:
 
 - Create an instance of this object and keep a strong reference to it.
 - (optional) Change any configuration if required.
 - (optional) Set a delegate (usually your UIViewController, or any other object that conforms to HFCaptureSessionDelegate protocol ).
 - (optional) Set a HFGCameraView view, so capture session will be able to send processed frames to be displayed to the user in real time.
 
 Some code examples:
 
     // Initialization
     HFGCaptureSession *hcf = [HFGCaptureSession new];
     hcf.delegate = self;
     hcf.cameraPreviewView = self.someHFCameraViewIBOutlet;
     [hcf setupAndStartCaptureSession];
     
     // Keeping a strong pointer to the capture session object.
     self.captureSession = hcf;
 */
@interface HFGCaptureSession : HFCObject

#pragma mark - Initializations
/**  @name Initializations */

/**
 Initializes the capture session object with default configuration.
 
 The default configuration is:
 
 - Camera will attempt to start capture in 640x480, cropping the image to 480x480 square before processing and displaying result.
 - Capture session will use the background removal algorithm for video processing.
 - Video processing, preview to the user and recording will be of 480x480 square images.
 - The algorithm will use the default contour/silhouette (see: HomageSDKCore -> HCBackground for more info).
