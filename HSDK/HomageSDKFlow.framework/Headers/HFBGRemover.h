/**
 The default implementation of the HFProcessingProtocol.
 Used by capture session by default, unless some other processor is implemented
 and passed to the capture session object.
 
 This class implements the HFProcessingProtocol and uses Homage SDK Core functionality
 of removing uniform background behind the captured users.
 It also uses the background detection functionality in Homage SDK Core. Information about
 the background quality is posted using notification center and can be captured by any observer
 on notifications named hfNotificationBGDetectionInfo.
